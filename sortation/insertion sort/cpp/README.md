## Sorting an Array using Insertion Sort

This program allows the user to enter the length of an array, and then enter the values to fill the array. The program then sorts the array using the insertion sort algorithm, and prints the sorted values to the console.

## How to Run the Program

To run the program, simply compile and execute the program in a C++ compiler. The program will prompt the user to enter the length of the array and the values to fill the array. After the array is filled, the program will sort the array using the insertion sort algorithm and print the sorted values to the console.

## Program Files

The program consists of a single C++ file, insertion_sort.cpp. This file contains the following functions:

* set_arr_length(): Prompts the user to enter the length of the array, and returns the value entered by the user.

* create_array(): Allocates memory for an array of the specified length, prompts the user to enter values to fill the array, and returns a pointer to the array.

* insertion_sort(): Sorts the array using the insertion sort algorithm, and returns a pointer to the sorted array.

* main(): Calls the set_arr_length(), create_array(), and insertion_sort() functions to sort an array of integers, and prints the sorted values to the console.

## Program Output

The program outputwill consist of the sorted values of the array entered by the user. The output will be displayed in the console, with each value printed on a new line. The program does not have any graphical user interface or output to a file.

## Possible Improvements

Here are some possible improvements that could be made to the program:

* Add error handling for invalid user input, such as entering non-integer values or negative array lengths.

* Implement other sorting algorithms to allow the user to choose the sorting algorithm they want to use.

* Add options for the user to input the array values from a file or generate random values.

* Improve the user interface by adding more informative messages or using a graphical user interface.

## Conclusion

This program demonstrates how to implement the insertion sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. The program can be easily modified to include other sorting algorithms or to add more features to the user interface.
